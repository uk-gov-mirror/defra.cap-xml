# Configure Rootless Docker

*These instructions are for use with native Docker on native Linux/systemd enabled WSL 2 **only** and assume that rootless Docker is installed.*

## Configure Visual Studio Code To Use Rootless Docker With Dev Containers

Ensure the Visual Studio Code user settings JSON file  contains a **dev.containers.dockerSocketPath** entry referencing the absolute path to the rootless Docker socket. For example: **"dev.containers.dockerSocketPath": "/run/user/1000/docker.sock"**.

## Ensure A Local Repository Exists For Use With A Dev Container

[Ensure that a local cap-xml repository for use with a development container exists on the host](./local-repository-creation.md)

The repository can be located anywhere on the Linux host accessible to the user account that runs a development container. This account
**must** also be the account that runs the rootless Docker socket. In the simplest case where the local repository is used to create a development container, the location **/opt/workspaces/**  (resulting in a local repository root of  **/opt/workspaces/cap-xml)** is suggested as it matches the location required when using macOS/non-systemd enabled WSL 2 with Docker Desktop. If the local repository is located elsewhere, [shell scripting ensures that the local repository will be utilised at runtime to enable code location for running/debugging purposes](../../../docker/scripts/link-workspace-folder-on-host-to-local-repository.sh).

## Mandatory Environment Variables

| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| LOCAL_CAP_XML_DIR | The **absolute** path to the root of a local cap-xml repository. |
| CAP_XML_HOST_USERNAME | Username for the **host** account used when creating a development container. This **must** be the account running rootless Docker and have entries in /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid accordingly. |

## Run Configuration Shell Script

[setup-for-rootless-docker-with-dev-container.sh](../../../docker/scripts/setup-for-rootless-docker-with-dev-container.sh) **must** be run as **root** before attempting to create a development container from either a local cap-xml repository or by cloning the remote cap-xml repository into a container volume. This script validates the mandatory environment variables and exits if configuration issues are detected. If no configuration issues are detected, the following actions are performed regardless of how development containers are created:

* Rootful Docker socket backup.
* Replacement of rootful Docker socket with a symbolic link to the rootless Docker socket.
  * This is required because the Docker socket used by LocalStack and [Docker outside Of Docker Compose](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/docker-outside-of-docker-compose) development containers does not appear to be configurable at the time of writing.
* Grant of rootless Docker socket read write access to the host SUBGID for the development container **vscode** user.

To facilitate development container creation from the local cap-xml repository, ownership of the local cap-xml repository is **transferred** to the host SUBUID and SUBGID for the development container **vscode** user.

* This action forces work to be performed within the development container rather than using the local cap-xml repository directly.
  * This prevents a risk of git reporting dubious file ownership that can occur when repository access is permitted from within and outside of a development container created from a local repository.
    * If direct work on the host is required, the creation of a distinct local cap-xml repository for this purpose is recommended.

**IMPORTANT** - User and group ownership of the **docker** directory within the local repository is retained by the host user and group temporarily to allow named
volumes to be created succesfully. Ownership of this directory is **transferred** to the host SUBUID and SUBGID for the development container **vscode** user in the
[post development container creation script](../../../docker/scripts/post-create-command.sh).

When creating a development container by cloning the remote cap-xml repository into a container volume, the development container user has ownership of items in the volume without risk of git reporting dubious ownership.

**IMPORTANT** - If [setup-for-rootless-docker-with-dev-container.sh](../../../docker/scripts/setup-for-rootless-docker-with-dev-container.sh) is run using the sudo command, the user session from which the sudo command is run **must** ensure that mandatory environment variables are available to the script. This is because user session environment variables are not available to a sudo command by default. For example, if the environment variables are available to the user session running the sudo command, they can be preserved for availability to [setup-for-rootless-docker-with-dev-container.sh](../../../docker/scripts/setup-for-rootless-docker-with-dev-container.sh) using the following sudo command:

```sh
sudo --preserve-env=LOCAL_CAP_XML_DIR,CAP_XML_HOST_USERNAME "$LOCAL_CAP_XML_DIR"/docker/scripts/setup-for-rootless-docker-with-dev-container.sh
```

### Housekeeping Considerations

**IMPORTANT** - The rootful Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) appears to be recreated in scenarios such as a system
reboot. As such [setup-for-rootless-docker-with-dev-container.sh](../../../docker/scripts/setup-for-rootless-docker-with-dev-container.sh) **must** be run following such scenarios to ensure that /var/run/docker.sock refers to the rootless Docker socket.

# Development Container Setup

A [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) automates a number of setup activities required for a functioning local development environment such as:

* Configuration of additional operating system package repositories.
* Installation of additional operating system packages.
* Addition of Visual Studio Code extensions.
* CAP XML database creation and reference data population using a containerised Postgres instance.
* Use of a [containerised Postgres Graphical User Interface](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-container/)
  for performing database operations.
* [LocalStack](https://www.localstack.cloud/) AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda
  provisioning to facilitate local running and debugging of CAP XML calls without round tripping
  to AWS infrastructure.
  * The [LocalStack AWS Command Line interface](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/) is
    used during provisioning and can also be used at runtime.
* Runtime environment variable configuration.
  * Configuration generation providing connectivity to local development environment resources.

Development containers are based on [Docker outside Of Docker Compose](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/docker-outside-of-docker-compose) with [LocalStack integration](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/devcontainers/#docker-outside-of-docker).

Development containers run as an unprivileged **vscode** user with passwordless sudo access.

The development environment as code approach ensures that all developers utilise a common development environment without having to follow detailed setup instructions that could be erroneous, incomplete or followed incorrectly.

If an existing local development environment has been configured manually **it is recommended that a backup of it is created before proceeding**.
